# Loanalytics

## Overview

    - Loanalytics consists of a multi-step approach to screen and validate loan applicants using data analytics and AI.
    - Our solution implements a process involving up to 3 steps to analyse a loan applicant’s risk factor using which 
     the applicant is allowed or denied a loan.
    - Once a loan is sanctioned, the system will continuously monitor the financial status of the applicant regularly to 
    predict a loan default in case of unforeseen circumstances after the loan application and sanction process.
    - The system focuses on customer experience as it’s a core fundamental to drive loyalty in a highly competitive 
     industry while also ensuring the bank’s financial interests are secured.

## Focal Points

    - Customer Satisfaction Our approach focuses on ensuring that clients who may be eligible for a loan aren’t 
       denied due to the inference of an AI model. Ensuring customer loyalty is highly consequential in the current competitive market
    - Multi-Modal Approach By implementing multiple models such as Random Forest Classification and Large Language 
      Models we can perform an over arching analysis of a loan applicant’s eligibility. This allows us to accurately filter out high 
      risk applicants while also ensuring that eligible applicants aren’t denied a loan.
    - Financial SecurityBy ensuring the usage of qualitative and quantitative data analytics driven filtering, we can ensure that 
      the bank can practise responsible lending by through loan default prediction and prevention. Continuous monitoring shall 
      allow us to reconsider the customers financial conditions in case unforeseen conditions elevate risk factors.

## Technology Stack

The proposed solution will make use of the following technologies:

    - ReactJS (Front-end library)
    - Random Forest Classifier (Quantitative Risk Prediction)
    - OpenAI API GPT4 (Qualitative Risk Prediction)
    - GithubPages (Static Hosting)




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
